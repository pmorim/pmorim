## About Me

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Pedro and I'm a Frontend Developer from Portugal.

I learned the basics of programming in C/C++ in my Bachelor's Degree in *Electrotechnical and Computers Engineering* and fell in love with it. Ever since that, I have been self-learning about all kinds of programming languages and technologies.

*"React is my wife, Svelte is my mistress."*
